Project Overview:

Create a robust, user-friendly platform that enables traders to monitor, analyze, and enhance their options trading activities. The platform should support secure user authentication, detailed trade logging, performance analytics, fee calculations, and community engagement features. Emphasize modularity, maintainability, and security throughout the development process.

Key Features and Requirements:

User Authentication and Profile Management:

Secure Registration and Login:

Implement user registration with email verification and secure password handling.
Ensure login sessions are secure and support password recovery options.
Profile Customization:

Allow users to manage personal information and trading preferences.
Platform Association:
Enable users to specify which trading platforms they use.
Allow assignment of trades to specific platform accounts.
Automatic Fee Calculation:
Maintain an up-to-date database of fee structures for various platforms.
Automatically calculate and apply platform-specific fees to trades.
Margin Settings:
Allow users to indicate if they are using margin trading.
Enable input of margin costs to ensure accurate fee accounting.
Trade Entry and Management:

Comprehensive Trade Logging:

Provide forms for users to input detailed trade information, including:
Underlying asset
Option type (call or put)
Strike price
Expiration date
Premium paid or received
Trade date
Quantity
Associated platform account
Margin usage details
Additional notes
Trade Tagging and Notes:

Allow users to tag trades with customizable labels for better organization.
Enable adding personal notes or observations to each trade entry.
Portfolio Overview Dashboard:

Real-Time Performance Monitoring:
Display summaries of open and closed positions.
Provide real-time profit and loss (P&L) calculations, accounting for platform fees and margin costs.
Offer visual representations of portfolio performance over time, such as charts and graphs.
Analytical Tools:

Trade Analysis:
Enable filtering and sorting of trades based on various criteria (e.g., date range, asset type, platform).
Generate reports on trading performance metrics, including:
Win/loss ratios
Average returns
Total net premium earned
Biggest single loss
Number of assignments
Average trade duration
Leaderboard and Community Engagement:

Trader Rankings:
Implement a leaderboard ranking traders based on Year-to-Date (YTD) statistics, such as:
Net Premium
Win Percentage
Total Wins
Total Losses
Biggest Loss
Assignments
Average Trade Duration
Ensure user privacy by allowing opt-in participation for the leaderboard.
